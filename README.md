# Darling.

### This is the code of my bot
So I'd prefer if You would just add it to your server with [this](https://eckigerluca.com/darling/invite) link.

### But if You want to host it by yourself,
rename the `config.json.public` to `config.json` and edit the values. The Bot **needs** the `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`, so make sure to enable it!

After that, use `npm i` to install all needed packages. When done, run the `index.js` and the bot should be online.
If yes, invite it to the server You want to use it on! (Check the image for permissions).

If the Bot won't start, check the console for any errors and if there are one's, create an Issue.
